# Pedestrain-track-phase-3-
Pedestrian Movement Prediction and Analysis Model is a project focused on tracking and analyzing pedestrian behavior using geospatial and time-series data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts pedestrian interaction types — such as crossing, waiting, or walking — based on movement patterns, timestamps, and orientation metrics. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains spatial, temporal, and positional features like coordinates, body orientation, and head orientation, along with details about nearby objects. By visualizing feature relationships and training a predictive model, the project aims to provide insights into pedestrian movement patterns, contributing to safer and more efficient public space management.
